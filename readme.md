## Features
Alot of the websites functionality and features are directly related to the visual themes and concepts at the core of its design. The core theme was to achieve a minimal yet elegant black and white composition, this was quite a time consuming process. Trying to keep the colour scheme minimal and consistent was actually quite difficult to achieve, as every element on the whole website had to be altered or filtered to ensure it was on 'brand'. The main header of the website ended up dictating which elements and colour choices would be suitable.    
### main header:



*emphasis*

**strong**

* list
